* Fixed an issue where some runs were throwing a comparator contract sort error due to lack of data in a particular base context and thus null fraction values

----USeq_8.8.4----
MergeSams
* Created a new app to merge sam and bam files.  Creates a stripped header from the files if one isn't provided.  This won't play nicely with downstream GATK or Picard apps. Have yet to find at good app for doing this, SamTools and Picard's are riddled with error/ validation headaches.
DefinedRegionDifferentialSeq
* Added catch for alignments that are run off the end of the last reported base in a chromosome
SamSplitter
* New app for splitting a sam file in half. Randomly assigns paired read groups to either half.

* Updated each to utilize the new DESeq2 algorithm.

----USeq_8.8.0----
DefinedRegionDifferentialSeq
* Updated DESeq to DESeq2, major changes, different dispersion fit, different log2Rto calculation, automatic independence filtering.  All results in more diff expressed genes compared to the older depreciated methods. Old diff genes are pretty much a subset of new diff genes.

----USeq_8.7.9----
RNAEditingScanSeqs and DefinedRegionRNAEditing
* Added option to exclude base observations where the editing was > 0 and supported by only one read

PullMatchingAlignments
* New app that writes out alignments that match read names contained in a second file.  The output is the alignment in sam format, 
preceded by true/false, depending on alignment status.

VCFSpliceAnnotator
* Bug fix for vcf output where vcf records with no changes were being truncated
VCFComparator
* Added catch for cases where no vcf records made it through the filtering.  These were crashing the application with some datasets.

----USeq_8.7.6----

* New app for scoring vcf files for gain or loss of splice junctions using the MaxEntScan algorithms.


----USeq_8.7.3----
DefinedRegionDifferentialSeq
* Changed the default minimum read count threshold to 20 from 10.  This lower number was allowing too many low hit genes into the multiple testing correct and causing the FDRs to be significantly lower than necessary.
VCFComparator
* Added checks to convert 0|1 genotypes to 0/1, and 1/0 calls to 0/1; these are needed to standardize the calls and enable genotype matching with the NIST key
SamTranscriptomeParser
* Bug fix for merging paired alignments where an insertion occurred immediately before the start of the second read
MultiSampleVCFFilter
* Fixed the behavior of the -M flag, wasn't intersecting the proper samples

BisSeq
* Modifications to support datasets lacking whole strands, needed for amplicon data.

----USeq_8.7.1----
DefinedRegionDifferentialSeq
* Fixed bug when DESeq was outputting FDRs with "NA", these were being assigned the max FDR, switched it to 0.  
Note, this won't effect standard analysis since these genes also have a log2 of 0 and wouldn't survive standard log2Ratio thresholding.

* Fixed a bug in the -b4 novoalignment parsing
* Remove support for native novoalign format, just sam/ bam now.

----USeq_8.7.0----
SRAProcessor

* Added another check for malformed sam records

----USeq_8.6.6----

----USeq_8.6.3----
MethylationArrayDefinedRegionScanner
* Modified app so it works with non even numbers of t and c
SamParser
* Modified the way the mid point of an alignment is calculate.  It is now the alignment start + 1/2 the read length. Did this to avoid problems with splice junction reads.
* Set the bam file reader stringency to silent.

----USeq_8.6.2----
RNAEditingScanSeqs
* Added a minimum base fraction edited option to app to restrict what base observations are allowed into the analysis.
RNAEditingPileUpParser
* Fixed a bug where the parser was counting all of the reference reads (both plus and minus) when scoring a base for editing instead of just reads mapping to the matched strand when a stranded parsing was selected.

----USeq_8.6.1----
RandomizeTextFile
* Added ability to process all files in a directory.
* Gzipping output.
FetchGenomicSequences
* Enabled working with gzipped fasta data
DefinedRegionDifferentialSeq
* Added ANOVA-like edgeR analysis to the output for runs with more than 2 conditions.

----USeq_8.6.0----
NovoalignBisulfiteParser
* Added option to parse xxx.bam files
* Removed -u unique alignment option since this only works with native novo format and was confusing the sam folks

SamTranscriptomeParser
* Modified app to gzip temp files and when a header is provided to directly write out the results without an intermediate file.  Should cut down on disk usage.
NovoalignBisulfiteParser
* Reduced the default thresholds for minimum base quality to 13.  New bis-seq data is showing reduced qualities (probably due to different calibration) causing some datasets to show a significant reduction in data.
* Added a fraction bases passing base quality to report out this statistic and flag such cases.
VCFComparator
* Added a new spreadsheet of just dFDR and TPR for each sample when more than one to make graphing easier.  

----USeq_8.5.7----
MultiSampleVCFFilter
* Added option to filter on VQSLOD scores

* Changed the default maximum alignment score to 90 instead of 60

----USeq_8.4.6----
CompareIntersectingRegions

Sam2USeq
* Added feature to take a file of regions and calculate base coverage statistics.  

----USeq_8.4.5----
Sam2USeq
* Fixed a bug with generating regions passing a defined read coverage.  If relative graphs were being generated then the app was thresholding for high coverage regions using the relative score instead of the read count.
SamTranscriptomeParser
* Added a checker for broken zero exon length splice junctions in alignments.  A warning is now thrown and these are skipped.
* For unique paired alignments, fixed the mate referenced and mate position for those hitting splice or transcript junctions.  These were still pointing to their non genomic coordinates.
UCSCGeneModelTableReader
* Added checker for zero length exons.  This will effect every USeq app that loads a UCSC gene table. It aborts if found.

----USeq_8.4.4----
MultipleReplicaScanSeqs
* Modified check for DESeq error message when dispersion fit fails.  New DESeq is using a different error message!  
FilterPointData
* Added another check to limit filtering for regions that go beyond the end of a chromosome
All apps
* Reorganized the USeq code base and MakeUSeq app to support an Eclipse centric SNV.
* Wrote up instructions on how build an Eclipse USeq project linked to the Sourceforge SVN and deploy modified USeq packages. See Documentation/buildingUSeqFromEclipseSVN.txt

Many apps
* Upgraded from org.apache.commons.math... to math3 for all chiSquare tests

----USeq_8.4.0----
DefinedRegionDifferentialSeq
* Added gzipper to geneStats.xls output
* Added bed file output for each condition comparison
* Added an option to exclude alignments that align to more than one location.  This uses the IH flag set by running the SamTranscriptomeParser on your raw alignments.
* Added a description of the columns to the usageRNASeq.html and outputFileTypeDescriptions.html documents 
* Added a read depth maximum, defaulting to 20K.  Genes/ regions containing one or more bases with with more than 20K overlapping alignments are excluded from the analyis.  This was needed to prevent rRNA contaminated libraries from spiking the application's memory.  It is also proving useful for excluding a few genes from driving DESeq's library abundance estimation with extreem read counts.
NovoalignBisulfiteParser
* Modified base level score checking to ignore reads with INDELs.  This was causing a mis reference to an incorrect score for the indel and potentially excluding it from the analysis. In some cases this also fixed a mis base score reference to non indel reads.

----USeq_8.3.9----
BisStat
* Added a catch to skip base context scanning when no data was found for a particular chromosome.
AggregatePlotter
* Added an option to average scores between shared bases across collapsed regions instead of summing.  This is useful for methylation analysis with the BisStat BaseFraction methylation data.

* Eliminated empty space columns from spread sheet output.  This feature was causing problems in Excel when selecting data for sorting.
AllelicMethylationDetector
* Added option to scan and score a user defined set of regions for allelic methylation
* Added a final sum total graph for all regions that passed thresholds
All Apps
* Added a call to all Apps to print the USeq_xxx version in the Arguments prior to running

----USeq_8.3.8----
Sam2USeq
* Fixed a bug that might effect some relative read coverage graphs when trying to convert the xxx.useq results files to xxx.bw for visualization in IGV and the UCSC Browser.  A rounding error after scaling was causing some data to look the same when infact it wasn't causing multiple stair step regions to be generated with the same position and score values.  
BisSeqAggregatePlotter
* Fixed a bug that was causing app to not merge data across chromosomes, thus old analysis only generated aggregates from the last chromosome of data.
